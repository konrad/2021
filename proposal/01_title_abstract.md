# Teaching Machine Learning at ECML2020

## Abstract

Machine Learning based approaches have become ubiquitous in many areas of society, industry and academia. Understanding what Machine Learning is, providing and reproducing what it infers, has become an essential prerequisite for adoption. In this line of thought, course materials, introductory media and lecture series of a broad variety, depth, quality and public availability have come to existence. With last years first edition of this workshop, we would like to commit ourselvs to the cause and continue the exchange of knowledge in the community. In this vein of thought, we want to continue an academic discussion on what works and what doesn't in order to help improve existing material and to make conceiving new material more effective for all parties involved.
