Peter received his PhD in Particle Physics in 2012 from the [TU Dresden](https://tu-dresden.de) for an experimental study of LHC data using the ATLAS experiment to reduce background contributions to Higgs Particle searches. He continued to industry as a HPC support and software engineer helping scientists push the limits of their applications in a service oriented group. In this role, he become increasingly exposed to Deep Learning applications for vision applications in biology. In 2019, he started to lead a group of AI consultants that aims to help scientists from the research field matter at [Helmholtz society](https://www.helmholtz.de/) to use machine learning in experiment and theory.
